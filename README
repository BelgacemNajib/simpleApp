This is a basic application using two containers. Public mosquitto image, and a custom image from node-red.
It is just a tool to assess the abilities of the different frameworks we will need to evaluate.

mosquitto image is juste a mqtt broker, nothing else.
Custom node-red image is based from node-red public image, it also contain a dashboard module to have a graphical things, and it contain 2 flows.
- One simulate a device who send periodicaly random numbers to mqtt topic (a producer)
- The auther one listen from this topic en show value to dashboard (a consumer)

How to use:
- Create your custom nodered image : `docker build -t mynodered .`
- If needed, change image name in docker-compose.yml file
- After start your application (`docker-compose up` if localy), go to <target-IP>:1880 to see flows and <targer-IP>:1880/ui to see dashboard
